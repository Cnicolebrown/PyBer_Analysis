# PyBer_Analysis

*Overview of Analysis*

The primary purpose of this analysis is to examine the effect of location type on total fares available, total driver count, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. The three types of location examined from the data sets were urban, semiurban, and rural. Two separate CSV files were taken and compiled together into a singular data frame in python to assist with the analysis. 

*Results*

From the results a table and graph was developed to help visulize the data.

Based on the results of the information, it appears that urban cities have more rides in total compared to rural and semi urban cities. Urban cities also have a higher count of drivers, with rural cities having the least amount; however, rural cities pay more for their rides per driver. While rural cities have less in total overall fares, they tend to spend more per individual ride than their counterparts this highlights some of the disparities facing rural communities. They have less access to drivers and rides but spend more compared to their urbanized counterparts. 

*Summary*

Based upon the analysis, rural areas need more assistance to reduce the cost of their ride shares. Below are three possible suggestions to help improve overall usage in these areas and mitigate these disparities. 

1. To help achieve this, discounts for passengers to encourage them to call for more ride shares may assist with this. This could be achieved through a frequent user rewards program, or a discount once certain milage is reached. 

2. Another way to improve the price disparities is the recruitment of more drivers in rural areas. Offering a sign on bonus for drivers who service this area my assist in recruitment, or some other form of compensation for drivers to expand their services into these areas. 

3. Finally, increasing the price of urban rides and reducing the cost of rural and semiurban rides may assist in the large variety of pricing. Drivers in urban areas cost less than those in rural areas, raising the price in these areas will allow for a reduction in price for the other regions and may encourage more frequent usage of ride share services.
